# Cloud Admin Guide Overview

This module teaches how to manage Amazon Web Services (AWS) instances — each instance being a Linux virtual machine. Using Bash Shell scripts, it is shown how to configure, create, stop, start, and delete, one or multiple instances with a single invocation of a script.

### Topic 1: Setting up the work environment 
Learn how to set up your working environment, your AWS account and your shell terminal configuration, to be able to run the scripts. 

### Topic 2: Managing AWS instances 
Learn some best practices to deploy and manage AWS instances for a course, for testing software configurations, for creating new AMIs. 

### Topic 3: Managing AMIs, Scripts
Learn the blurry bits of the scripts, how to control changes to the scripts with GitHub, the Cloud-SPAN AMIs, when and how to create and control AMI versions, updating an AMI Linux and software tools, and more.
