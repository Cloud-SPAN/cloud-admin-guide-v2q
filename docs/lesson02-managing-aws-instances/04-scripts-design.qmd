::: callout-tip
This episode has no hands-on activities but you should have covered the two previous episodes, [Instances Management Tasks Using the Scripts](./02-instances-management.qmd) and [AMIs Management](./03-ami-management.qmd), to better understand the concepts presented in this episode.
:::

# Overview

1. **[The Scripts Design](#the-scripts-design)**\
How the Scripts are organised and how they work internally are the subjects of this section. 
2. **[The AWS CLI Command Reference](#the-aws-cli-command-reference)**\
The Scripts functionality depends on the AWS CLI commands. This section briefly describes the AWS CLI interface and how we used it to develop the Scripts.
3. **[Improving the Scripts](#improving-the-scripts)**\
This section describes a few improvements for the Scripts that we may later undertake.


# 1. The Scripts Design
This section describes the organisation and workings of the Scripts. The paper [Automated management of AWS instances for training](https://gigabytejournal.com/articles/133), in the section "***The scripts design and implementation***" discusses other aspects of the scripts design that complement this section. After you read this section and that section in the paper, you will know where to look into the Scripts in case you need to improve them. 

Let's recall the Scripts names:

``` {.default filename="Output"}
aws_domainNames_create.sh       aws_instances_terminate.sh      csinstances_create.sh
aws_domainNames_delete.sh       aws_loginKeyPair_create.sh      csinstances_delete.sh
aws_instances_configure.sh      aws_loginKeyPair_delete.sh      csinstances_start.sh
aws_instances_launch.sh         colour_utils_functions.sh       csinstances_stop.sh
```

## Organisation into modules
Recall that you run `csinstances_create.sh` to create one or multiple **instances** specified in an "***instancesNames.txt***" file (whose name you can choose), and that each instance is accessed with `ssh` using a **login key** and a **domain name** or an **IP address** (if domain names are not managed).

The main code of `csinstances_create.sh` is below. **All it does** is to run the `aws_*.sh` scripts that *actually* **create** instances and related resources, passing to each such script the parameter it received, the path/name of the "*instancesNames.txt*" file which, being the first and only parameter you specify, is stored in the script variable **`$1`** 

The script `csinstances_delete.sh` is organised and works the same way but it runs the scripts that *actually* **delete** instances and related resources instead.

``` {.bash filename="csinstances_create.sh"}
check_theScripts_csconfiguration   "$1" || { message "$error_msg"; exit 1; }
aws_loginKeyPair_create.sh 		   "$1" || { message "$error_msg"; exit 1; }
aws_instances_launch.sh			   "$1" || { message "$error_msg"; exit 1; }
if [ -f "${1%/*}/.csconfig_DOMAIN_NAMES.txt" ]; then  ### %/* gets the inputs directory path
    aws_domainNames_create.sh 	   "$1" || { message "$error_msg"; exit 1; }
fi
aws_instances_configure.sh 		   "$1" || { message "$error_msg"; exit 1; }
exit 0
```

That all means that each `aws_*.sh` script is in charge of:

- a **single type** of AWS service request (either *create, allocate, .., deallocate, or delete*) 
- for **one** or **multiple** AWS resources **all of the same type** (either *instance, login key, or domain name*).\
Each script makes an AWS service request for each instance name specified in the file "*instancesNames.txt*".

Such organisation means that **all** login keys are created first, then **all** instances are created, etc. --- and vice versa: **all** instances are deleted first, then **all** login keys are deleted, etc.  

An alternative way to organise the Scripts would be such that: each instance and its resources (login key, etc.) are created first, then a second instance and its resources are created, and so on. But the code gets much more complicated.

::: callout-note
## Exercise

Think of that alternative organisation for the Scripts or any other organisation you would like for the Scripts.

- Is it really more complex? 
- Why? 
- How would `csinstances_create.sh` be organised? 
- Do we need more or fewer scripts?

If you thought of another alternative organisation, what is the main flow in creating instances and their resources?
:::

## The `aws_*.sh` scripts main processing steps

Each `aws_*.sh` script makes an AWS service request for each instance name specified in the file "*instancesNames.txt*" through these main steps:

1. getting the location of relevant "shared data" from the path of the file "*instancesNames.txt* (received as parameter), that is:

    - the path of the configuration files `resourcesIDs.txt` and `tags.txt`, whose content is required by the scripts that **create** instances and related resources.
    - the path of results files (in the `outputs` directory) that contain the AWS resources IDs, which are required by the scripts that **delete** instances and related resources, and the scripts `csinstances_stop.sh` and `csinstances_start.sh`.
    
2. making a list of instances names from the names specified in the file "*instancesNames.txt*".

3. looping  through the instances names list to request, for each instance, the script-relevant AWS service operation through running `aws` passing required parameters --- some parameters are extracted from the files in step 1.

::: callout-note
## Exercise
The code structure of `csinstances_stop.sh` and `csinstances_start.sh` is similar to that to the code structure of the `aws_*.sh` scripts.

Can you figure out the reason for that (before looking at the code)?
:::

## The Scripts "shared data" communication
Breaking down the functionality of the Scripts as described above, or of any software system for that matter, involves designing communication between the parts. Such communication can be based either on **message passing** or **shared data**. Message passing is **explicit** communication between two or more specific parts. Shared data is **implicit** communication: all parts know where the shared data is.

The Scripts use both types of communication:

- *message passing* is used when passing the name of an "*instancesNames.txt*" file to and between the Scripts.
- *shared data* is used when accessing data in the files in the `inputs` and `outputs` directories of a course --- which is possible through using specific names and locations for those files which, in turn, makes it possible to determine their path from the path of the "*instancesNames.txt*" file. 

### Getting the path of the `inputs` and `outputs` directories
All the `aws_*.sh` scripts get the path to the shared directories `inputs` and `outputs` thus:

``` {.bash filename="Code"}
instancesNamesFile=${1}           # $1 or ${1} is the path of "instancesNames.txt" received as parameter
inputsDir=${1%/*}                 # inputs directory path
outputsDir=${1%/inputs*}/outputs  # outputs directory path
```

### Making the path of the `outputs`/"results" directory 
Then, each `aws_*.sh` script that **creates** instances or related resources will use only one of the assignment statements below to make the path of the directory where it will create a file to write the results of each AWS service request that it will issue for each instance name specified in the file "*instancesNames.txt*":

``` {.bash filename="Code"}
outputsDirThisRun=${outputsDir}/login-keys-creation-output
outputsDirThisRun=${outputsDir}/instances-creation-output
outputsDirThisRun=${outputsDir}/domain-names-creation-output
```

Each `aws_*.sh` script that **deletes** instances or related resources will use only one of the assignment statements below, instead:

``` {.bash filename="Code"}
outputsDirThisRun=${outputsDir}/login-keys-delete-output`date '+%Y%m%d.%H%M%S'`
outputsDirThisRun=${outputsDir}/instances-delete-output`date '+%Y%m%d.%H%M%S'`
outputsDirThisRun=${outputsDir}/domain-names-delete-output`date '+%Y%m%d.%H%M%S'`
```

You will remember that the results of deleting instances and related resources are written to directories whose names are suffixed with the current date and time.

### Getting the "shared data" in the files `tags.txt` and `resourcesIDs.txt`
The scripts `aws_instances_launch.sh` and `aws_loginKeyPair_create.sh` load the tags in the file `../inputs/tags.txt`, if it exists, into the variable `tagsAWS` as a `json` key-value object (only 10 tags are processed):

<!-- ::: {.column-page} -->
``` {.bash filename="Code"}
# process the tags.txt file if it exists. If so, it has been checked before as to having 2 fields (keyName keyValue) per line
# only 10 tags (key-value pairs, 20 fields) are processed.

tagsAWS=""
if [ -f $inputsDir/tags.txt ]; then
    TAGS=( `cat $inputsDir/tags.txt` )

    tagsNumber=${#TAGS[@]}
    [[ $tagsNumber > 20 ]] && (( tagsNumber=20 ))

    for (( i = 0; i < $tagsNumber ; i=i+2  ))
    do
	tagsAWS="${tagsAWS}{ Key=${TAGS[$i]}, Value=${TAGS[$i+1]} }, "
    done
fi
```
<!-- ::: -->

The script `aws_instances_launch.sh` gets the AWS resources IDs in the file `../inputs/resourcesIDs.txt` as follows:

::: {.column-page}
``` {.bash filename="Code"}
# get the resourcesIDs.txt values for configuration - they have been checked and validated before
resource_image_id=`awk -F " "           'tolower($1) == "imageid"         {print $2}' $inputsDir/resourcesIDs.txt`
resource_instance_type=`awk -F " "      'tolower($1) == "instancetype"    {print $2}' $inputsDir/resourcesIDs.txt`
resource_security_group_ids=`awk -F " " 'tolower($1) == "securitygroupid" {print $2}' $inputsDir/resourcesIDs.txt`
resource_subnet_id=`awk -F " "          'tolower($1) == "subnetid"	      {print $2}' $inputsDir/resourcesIDs.txt`
```
:::

Only the `aws_instances_launch.sh` uses the resources IDs.

The `aws_*.sh` scripts that **delete** instances or related resources don't need nor use the "shared data" in the files `tags.txt` and `resourcesIDs.txt`. 

## The Scripts **loop** through instances names 
Once an `aws_*.sh` script sets access to "shared data" as described above, the script goes through the **loop** where, for each instance name in the "*instancesNames.txt*" file, the script invokes the AWS service request it is in charge of. 

The loop of the script `aws_instances_launch.sh` (which creates one or multiple instances) is shown below. We have added the line numbers on the left for convenience but they don't correspond to the actual line numbers in the script. 

::: {.column-page}
``` {.bash filename="aws_instances_launch.sh - main loop"}
01 instancesNames=( `cat $instancesNamesFile` )
02 for instanceFullName in ${instancesNames[@]}
03 do
04    instance=${instanceFullName%-src*}		### get rid of suffix "-srcAMInn.." if it exists
05    loginkey=login-key-$instance
06    aws ec2 run-instances --image-id  $resource_image_id --instance-type  $resource_instance_type \
07	     --key-name $loginkey  \
08	     --security-group-ids $resource_security_group_ids \
09	     --subnet-id $resource_subnet_id \
10	     --tag-specifications \
11	     "ResourceType=instance, Tags=[{Key=Name, Value=$instanceFullName}, $tagsAWS ]" >  $outputsDirThisRun/$instance.txt 2>&1   
12    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
13	      message "`colour gl Success` creating `colour bl instance:` $instance"  $outputsDirThisRun/$instance.txt
14    else
15	      message "`colour red Error` ($?) creating `colour bl instance:` $instance"  $outputsDirThisRun/$instance.txt
16	      exit 2
17    fi
18 done
19 exit 0
```
:::

Line **01**: the variable `instancesNames` is initialised as a list of the instances names in the file "*instancesNames.txt*" file (variable `$instancesNamesFile`).

Line **02**: the loop starts, using the variable `instanceFullName` to store the instance name in turn.

Line **04**: `instance=${instanceFullName%-src*}` store the instance name in the variable `instance` but without the suffix `-srcAMInn` (`%-src*`) that identifies the source AMI template to create the instance, if it was specified, see the section [Instances names we use](./03-ami-management.qmd#instances-names-we-use) in the previous episode.

Line **05**: `loginkey=login-key-$instance` store the login key name in the variable `loginkey` to pass it as parameter to `aws` (in line 07). Each login key name is created with the fixed prefix `login-key-` concatenated to the instance name (in the `instance` variable).

Lines **06-11** is a single command --- the character `\`, at the end of lines 06-10, tells Bash to carry on reading input before running the command. This command **runs** the **AWS CLI** program, which is called `aws`, requesting to launch an instance, passing various parameters including: `--image-id` (AMI id), .. and the tags in the variable `tagsAWS` (previously loaded from the file `../inputs/tags.txt`). The parameters to `aws` are discussed below.

Line **11**: the results of invoking `aws` are stored in the file whose name is specified by the value in the variables `$outputsDirThisRun/$instance.txt` which were previously defined before and within the loop, respectively. Both results and any errors, if any, are written to that file (`2&1`).

### The loops in the other scripts
The loop in each of all other `aws_*.sh` scripts is similar to the loop shown above in that:

- the `instance` loop variable is used to create the name of other files to access therein data that is relevant to the function of the script. Recall that:\
"*Each instance name is the key to access each instance results files in the* `outputs` *directory*".
- `aws` is run to make the corresponding AWS service request.
- results and errors of invoking `aws` are saved to a file in the `outputs`/script-results/ directory.

The loop in the scripts below are somewhat different to all others:

- **`aws_domainNames_create.sh`**:\
    *Before* invoking `aws` to create a domain name (for the `instance` being processed in the loop), `aws_domainNames_create.sh` creates a .json file with the details of the domain name to be created, and then invokes `aws` passing the path of that file as a parameter along with other parameters.   

- **`aws_loginKeyPair_create.sh`**:\
*After* invoking `aws` to create a login key (for the `instance` being processed in the loop), if the invocation was **Successful**, `aws_loginKeyPair_create.sh` unpacks the login key from the results file (of invoking `aws`) into a `.pem` file. Such results are returned in .json format, which includes a key-value pair for each item of information returned, for example: "KeyName": "login-key-instance01"; "KeyPairId": "key-0f2702d75934347e4"; "KeyMaterial": "*the-login-key-itself*", among  other items of information. The value of  "**KeyMaterial**" is extracted from the resuts file, and somewhat processed before writing it onto a `.pem` file. Such processing is required for the login keys to work in MacOS machines.

- **`aws_instances_configure.sh`**, **`csinstances_stop.sh`**, and **`csinstances_start.sh`**:\
The loop through instance names in these scripts is somewhat more complex than in the other scripts, as conﬁguring, stopping and starting instances require different handling depending on whether **domain names are managed** or **not**, and these scripts handle both scenarios.

# 2. The AWS CLI Command Reference 
The code box below shows some of the `aws` (AWS CLI) commands used by the Scripts. For each command, only the first three parameters passed to `aws` by the Scripts are shown. The Scripts pass quite a few more parameters to those commands as exemplified by the code of `aws_instances_create.sh` above.

``` {.bash filename="Code"}
aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name ..
aws ec2 delete-key-pair --key-name ..
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id  ..
aws ec2 terminate-instances  --instance-ids ..
aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id ..
aws ec2 describe-volumes --filters ..
```

The first parameter to `aws` identifies the target AWS service: `ec2` and `route53` (in the code box). The service `ec2` stands for Elastic Compute Cloud which comprises quite a few sub-services or resources such as: login keys, AMI, IP addreses, volumes, snapshots, etc. The service `route53` is the one that deals with domain names.

The second parameter (`create-key-pair`, .., or `describe-volumes`) is the operation we want the AWS service to perform. Each of the operations above has the form *verb-noun*, or *action-onWhat*, thus identifying the type of EC2 resource on which the operation is to be applied.

The following parameters (third, fourth, etc.) are organised as "***key value***" pairs (see the code of `aws_instances_launch.sh` above). These are *parameters to the operation* (the second parameter to `aws`), and serve both to identify the target specific AWS resource to be affected and to specify how the resource will be affected by the operation requested.

The AWS CLI (`aws`) is extremely powerful and flexible. The Scripts only use only a minor part of it. The AWS CLI enables you to access and modify any AWS service and any type of resource within each service. At the time of writing, there are over 100 AWS services of which EC2 is one of them; EC2 has over 200 *operation-resource* operations.

If you plan to improve the Scripts and this involves changing the `aws` commands in the Scripts, you need to consult the [AWS CLI Command Reference](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/index.html) --- the landing page is shown below. 

Overall, in trying a new `aws` command you should aim to have a simple version of the new command running as soon as possible and then tune it gradually. For this purpose, look at the relevant  examples in the AWS CLI Command Reference. The screenshots below show you how to get to the Examples of the `aws ec2 run-instances` command that creates (runs and launches) instances. Our Script `aws_instances_launch.sh` uses a version of those examples.

On the "AWS CLI Command Reference" page, click on **Available Services** and scroll down until you find **ec2** and click on it.

![](/images/04-the-Scripts-design/02-aws-cli-cmd-ref-services-list-including-ec2.png){width="900px" fig-alt="Screenshot of AWS CLI Command Reference page in a browser, scrolled down and showing the option ec2 circled"}

The page of "ec2" will be presented. Click on **Available Commands** and scroll down until you find **run-instances** and click on it.

The page of "run-instances" will be presented. Click on **Examples**. 

![](/images/04-the-Scripts-design/05-aws-cli-cmd-ref-ec2-run-instances-page.png){width="900px" fig-alt="Screenshot of AWS CLI run-instances page in a browser, showing the option Examples circled"}

The page below will be presented. You can see the resemblance between the code in the examples below and the code in our Script `aws_instances_launch.sh`. The main difference being our use of shell variables to tune the `aws` command within the loop according to each instance name, etc.  

We developed all the Scripts starting with the relevant examples in the AWS CLI Command Reference.

# 3. Improving the Scripts
The Scripts provide enough functionality to manage well one or multiple AWS instances in the context of hands-on training and similar contexts, wherein each instance is to be used by a single person for a relatively short period of time. 

Other contexts will most likely need modifying the scripts and, of course, the scripts can be improved somehow. This is a list of improvements that we have identified:

1. Handling comments in the configuration files `tags.txt` and "*instancesNames.txt*" files. This will make those files more readable.

2. Code naming conventions and comments in the Scripts can be improved.

3. Adding the `--dry-run` option to the Scripts would facilitate development. The AWS CLI (`aws`) supports a `--dry-run` and it would be a matter of handling that option within the Scripts.

Congratulations! You have completed the Automated Management of AWS Instances course.
